## Market-Derived Fantasy Football Projections

This project will aim to generate an app containing weekly fantasy football projections based on player prop betting lines from popular US sportsbooks (Fanduel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caeser's).

The project is on hold for the time being and will be targeting release for Week 1 of the 2025-2026 NFL season.

If you are interested in contributing to the early stages of the project please email me at degregorioandre@gmail.com.
